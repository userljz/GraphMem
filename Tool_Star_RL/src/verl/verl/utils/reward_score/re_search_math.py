We are given a grid where transforming two neighboring chips costs 1 rouble and swapping two chips with exactly four chips between them is free. The objective is to invert the sequence of chips, and our goal is to calculate the minimum number of roubles required. Let’s start by making a hypothesis on how to effectively utilize these operations.</think>\n\n<think> Let's first investigate what happens when we swap two chips with exactly four chips between them. If we swap, it doesn't consume a rouble but only changes their positions indirectly as stated. We need a strategy to use this free swap operation in a way that minimizes our cost.</think>\n\n<search> search query: What is the grid configuration and initial state given in the problem? </search>\n <result>\n\"Laplacian matrix\"\npoints are specified to have a positive value, while the rest of the values in the grid are zero. Over time, the exponential decay acts to distribute the values at these points evenly throughout the entire grid. The complete Matlab source code that was used to generate this animation is provided below. It shows the process of specifying initial conditions, projecting these initial conditions onto the eigenvalues of the Laplacian Matrix, and simulating the exponential decay of these projected initial conditions. The graph Laplacian matrix can be further viewed as a matrix form of an approximation to the (positive semi-definite)\n\n\"Solution algorithms for pressure-velocity coupling in steady flows\"\ntake the form: The summation covers all nodes and volumes in the immediate vicinity of the selected node. Their values are shown in the next figure. Following this, The algorithms can be applied to get the solutions for the basic staggered grid equations. The acronym stands for Semi- Implicit method for pressure-linked equations. It is essentially a guess and correct procedure for the calculation of the staggered grid pressure field. These have been illustrated using a two dimensional steady flow. Step 1 :- A pressure field p* is guessed. Step 2 :- The Discretized momentum equations are solved using the\n\n\"Riemann problem\"\nof the grid. For that it is widely used in computational fluid dynamics and in MHD simulations. In these fields Riemann problems are calculated using Riemann solvers. As a simple example, we investigate the properties of the one-dimensional Riemann problem in gas dynamics, with initial conditions given by where \"\"x\"\" = 0 separates two different states, together with the linearised gas dynamic equations (see gas dynamics for derivation). where we can assume without loss of generality formula_3.

Data that form grid point that identifies grid cell are needed. As each cell is formed it is numbered and the points are sorted. In addition the neighbor cell information is needed.

This shows necessity to further clarify or consider other parts of the problem's initial description under which we have operations with chips.\n\nLet's consider the chips represented in a linear sequence of cells rather than a grid, as we are working with neighboring operations for chip swaps. We hypothesize that we use the free swap operation to effectively reverse the sequence without incurrence of roubles, then apply the paying operation in the most strategic way to complete the reversal process if necessary.</think>\n\n<think> Now, let's focus on the operations and the strategy. Here, a fixed length of 100 seems irrelevant to our greedy focus on minimizing the number of operations – it's the movement and interchanging that are important. We've observed that pairwise swaps ranked by exchanging two neighboring chips can enumerate costs for reversibility</think>\n\n<think>We hypothesize that to reverse a sequence, we could swap in pairs over the sequence alternately without incurring costs and only using paying swaps in 'buffered' spaces. Given N chips, we find how many operations are required—and the pattern of sequence reversal hints that the solution is closer to one latency trade-off</think> \n\n<think> Thus with the understanding that we can reverse \\(n\\) items with no cost by optimally leveraging the free swaps, the remaining work involves chip rearrangement by minimally incurring roubles. For two neighboring chips in reverse, swapping results in expenditure per two items with n iterations, totaling cost</think>\n\n<think> Revisiting the problem with a direct calculation, each full reversal across our linear model requires \\(N-1\\) operations.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Given Equations:**\n   \\[\n   \\log_{10}(\\sin x) + \\log_{10}(\\cos x) = -1\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of logarithms, we can combine the logs:\n   \\[\n   \\log_{10}(\\sin x \\cos x) = -1 \\implies \\sin x \\cos x = 10^{-1} = \\frac{1}{10}\n   \\]\n   Recall the double-angle identity for sine: \\(\\sin(2x) = 2 \\sin x \\cos x\\). So,\n   \\[\n   \\sin(2x) = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Given Equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\log_{10}(\\sin x + \\cos x) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\log_{10}(n) - 1)\n   \\]\n   We can rewrite the right-hand side using properties of logarithms:\n   \\[\n   \\log_{10}(\\sin x + \\cos x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log_{10}(n) - \\frac{1}{2} = \\log_{10}(n^{1\/2}) - \\log_{10}(10^{1\/2}) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sqrt{10}}\\right)\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   \\sin x + \\cos x = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sqrt{10}}\n   \\]\n   Squaring both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   (\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 = \\frac{n}{10}\n   \\]\n   Expanding the left side:\n   \\[\n   \\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x + 2 \\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{n}{10}\n   \\]\n   Using the Pythagorean identity \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\) and the earlier result \\(\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{1}{10}\\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) = \\frac{n}{10} \\implies 1 + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{n}{10} \\implies \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{n}{10} \\implies n = 12\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this with Python code to ensure the result is accurate.\n </think><python>\nimport math\r\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, log, sin, cos\r\n\r\n# Define the variable\r\nx = symbols('x')\r\n\r\n# First equation: log10(sin(x)) + log10(cos(x)) = -1\r\neq1 = Eq(log(sin(x), 10) + log(cos(x), 10), -1)\r\n\r\n# Solve for sin(x) * cos(x)\r\nsin_x_cos_x = solve(eq1, sin(x) * cos(x))[0]\r\nsin_x_cos_x = sin_x_cos_x.simplify()\r\n\r\n# We know sin(x) * cos(x) = 1\/10\r\nsin_x_cos_x_value = 1 \/ 10\r\n\r\n# Second equation: log10(sin(x) + cos(x)) = 1\/2 * (log10(n) - 1)\r\nn = symbols('n')\r\neq2 = Eq(log(sin(x) + cos(x), 10), (1\/2) * (log(n, 10) - 1))\r\n\r\n# We know (sin(x) + cos(x))^2 = 1 + 2 * sin(x) * cos(x) = 1 + 2 * (1\/10) = 6\/5\r\nsin_x_plus_cos_x_squared = 6 \/ 5\r\nsin_x_plus_cos_x = math.sqrt(sin_x_plus_cos_x_squared)\r\n\r\n# Substitute sin(x) + cos(x) into the second equation\r\nlhs = log(sin_x_plus_cos_x, 10)\r\nrhs = (1\/2) * (log(n, 10) - 1)\r\n\r\n# Solve for n\r\nn_value = solve(Eq(lhs, rhs), n)[0]\r\nprint(n_value)\n</python><result>\n\n12.0000000000000\n</result> <answer>The value of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).
